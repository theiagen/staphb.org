<h5 id="bioinformatics">Bioinformatics</h5>
<p>This discipline is involved in the collection, analysis, and storage of complex biological data, including, but not limited to genetic data. The field combines computer science, statistics, and several aspects of biology to be able to understand highly complex data.</p>
<h5 id="amd-advanced-molecular-detection">AMD (Advanced Molecular Detection)</h5>
<p>This commonly may mean any form of sequencing or high-level molecular technology. There is an Office of Advanced Molecular Detection (OAMD) at CDC that provides support and input on many cross-cutting areas using advanced technologies</p>
<h4 id="genomics">Genomics</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene</strong> – sequence of DNA that encodes a region for a molecule (ie protein or enzymes) with function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genotype vs Phenotype</strong> – <strong>Genotypes</strong> are the genetic make-up of an individual. <strong>Phenotypes</strong> are the physical traits and characteristics of an individual and are influenced by their genotype and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene Regulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cis regulation</strong> – Any molecular interaction that regulates the transcription of nearby genes on the same DNA molecule, such as the role of a gene promote</li>
<li><strong>Trans regulation</strong> – Any molecular interaction that regulates the transcription of genes on a different DNA molecule, such as a transcription factor regulating both alleles of a target gene or genes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indels</strong> – A type of DNA sequence variation marked by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, Defined as insertion or deletion of bases in the genome of an organism. An INDEL mutation named with the blend of insertion and deletion. It refers to a length difference between two allele caused by a SEQUENCE INSERTION or by a SEQUENCE DELETION.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile elements</strong> – sequences of DNA that have the ability to move from one organism to another, move into different locations in a genome or change the copy number in the bacteria. These element include plasmids, bacteriophages and transposable elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mutation Rates</strong> – rate in which a single nucleotide is replaced by a different nucleotide
Recombination – rearrangement of genetic material. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes can perform recombination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operon</strong> – It is a genetic regulatory system found in bacteria and their viruses in which genes coding for functionally related proteins are clustered along the DNA. This feature allows protein synthesis to be controlled coordinately in response to the needs of the cell. A typical operon consists of a group of structural genes that code for enzymes involved in a metabolic pathway, such as the biosynthesis of an amino acid. These genes are located contiguously on a stretch of DNA and are under the control of one promoter (a short segment of DNA to which the RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription). A single unit of messenger RNA (mRNA) is transcribed from the operon and is subsequently translated into separate proteins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Structural variants (SVs)</strong> – DNA sequence variants that are 50bp or larger, including insertions, deletions, inversions, duplications and translocations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>BASH / Shell Script</strong> – A programming language that is directly used by the Linux operating system. It allows for direct control of the operating system functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command line / Command based</strong> – The command line allows the user to interact with their computer without graphical user interface (GUI) or mouse. The command line is essential to perform bioinformatics analysis. It allows the user to manipulate files and programs in ways that are not possible using a GUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linux</strong> – An operating system much like Windows or OSX. The field of bioinformatics relies heavily on Linux-based computers and software. Although some bioinformatics programs can be compiled to run on Mac OS X and Windows systems, many require the Linux environment to run properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PERL</strong> – Another programming language similar to Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Python</strong> – Python is a popular programming language object often used for scientific computing. The Biopython utilize python-based software for bioinformatics research, thereby creating high quality reusable modules and scripts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sequencing-instruments-and-chemistry">Sequencing Instruments and Chemistry</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PacBio</strong> –  It is a single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing developed by Pacific Biosciences, also referred as PacBio sequencing. Unlike second generation sequencing, PacBio sequences each base-pair individually. Currently, this method is widely used to study larger genomes, transcriptome metagenomics and epigenetics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tape station</strong> – The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Tape Station) is a microfluidics-based platform for size determination, quantification and quality control of DNA and RNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pyrosequencing</strong> –  In pyrosequencing, the sequencing reaction is monitored through the release of the pyrophosphate during nucleotide incorporation. A single nucleotide is added to the sequencing chip which will lead to its incorporation in a template dependent manner. This incorporation will result in the release of pyrophosphate which is used in a series of chemical reactions resulting in the generation of light. Light emission is detected by a camera which records the appropriate sequence of the cluster. Any unincorporated bases are degraded by apyrase before the addition of the next nucleotide. This cycle continues until the sequencing reaction is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paired end sequencing</strong> –
<img src="http://www.staphb.org/images/paired_end.png" alt="Paired_End"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It involves sequencing both ends of the DNA fragment and generate high quality sequence data. It’s a simple work flow allows generation of unique ranges of insert sizes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Long read sequencing</strong> – Third generation sequencing also known as long read sequencing (LRS). LRS allows for the retrieval of much longer (&gt;10,000bp) sequencing reads than widely-used short read sequencing systems (75-300bp). Long-read sequencing (LRS) has become increasingly important due to its strengths in resolving complex DNA regions as well as in determining full-length RNA molecules. Two important LRS technologies have been developed during the past few years, including single-molecule, real-time sequencing by Pacific Biosciences, and nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short read sequencing</strong> – Next generation sequencing also known as short read sequencing. The technology utilizes highest output platform continue to have relatively short read lengths on the order of 35-300 bases per read. The amazing increase in data output and decrease in cost per base sequenced has been driven primarily short-read sequencing technologies such as the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Massively parallel sequencing</strong> – Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology, also referred to as next-generation sequencing, is a high-throughput approach to DNA sequencing in which miniaturized, parallelized platforms are used for sequencing 1 million to 43 billion short reads per instrument run. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is transforming the landscape of clinical microbiology and public health laboratories. The applications of NGS are wide-ranging and include whole-genome sequencing, microbiome analysis/metagenomics, transcriptome profiling, infectious disease diagnosis, pathogen discovery, and public health surveillance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Base Calling</strong> – Base calling is the process of assigning nucleotides or bases (ATGC) with chromatogram peaks. Next generation sequencing platforms, which use fluorescently labeled reversible terminators have a unique color for each base. These are incorporated in to the complementary strand of the DNA template and captured with a sensitive CCD camera. These images are processed into signals which are used to infer the order of nucleotides also referred as base calling. The accuracy is, measured by a Q score (Phred quality score), a common metric to assess the accuracy of a sequencing run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adapter</strong> – They are oligonucleotides bound to 5’ and 3’ end of each fragment in a sequencing library. Adapters include platform-specific sequences for fragment recognition by the sequencer. For example, the P5 and P7 sequences enable library fragments to bind to the flow cells of Illumina platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Barcode sequences</strong> – Multiplex sequencing allows large numbers of libraries to be pooled and sequenced simultaneously during a single run on a high-throughput Illumina NextGen sequencer. Individual &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; sequences are added to each DNA fragment during next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation so that each read can be identified and sorted out based on the fingerprinting of the genome prior to final data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sanger Sequencing</strong> – DNA sequencing method that relies on a primer to bind to the DNA sequence of interest to amplify the region of interest, sequences a single DNA fragment</p>
