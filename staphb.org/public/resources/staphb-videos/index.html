<h4 id="may-2020---bacterial-genome-analysis-using-bactopia">May 2020 - Bacterial Genome Analysis Using Bactopia</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;ve invited Robert Petit and Tim Read from Emory University to present on Bactopia, &ldquo;an extensive workflow for processing Illumina sequencing of bacterial genomes. The goal of Bactopia is to process your data with a broad set of tools, so that you can get to the fun part of analyses quicker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This work was inspired by Staphopia, previous work from Tim and Robert presented to StaPH-B that also enabled extensive data processing, but was built specifically for Staphylococcus aureus read data. Tim and Robert have created a new series of pipelines called Bactopia, built on the Nextflow platform, to provide efficient comparative genomic analysis for any bacterial species or genus. Bactopia can be accessed through GitHub, Docker, Singularity, and Conda.</p>

<h4 id="april-2020---covid-19-special-episode-3-local-nextstrain">April 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 3: Local Nextstrain</h4>
<p>As a follow up to our last call, during which Alli Black from the Bedford laboratory spoke about the NextStrain platform and its applications in COVID-19 response efforts, we invited Heather Blankenship&ndash;a bioinformatics scientist at the Michigan public health laboratory&ndash;to speak about her experience setting up a local NextStrain build for real-time COVID-19 surveillance in Michigan.</p>
<p>Heather discussed the advantages of local NextStrain builds for state laboratories and outlined the steps she has taken to set things up in her environment. Following this, we opened the floor for a Q&amp;A session with Heather.

<h5 id="january-2020---staph-b-toolkit">January 2020 - StaPH-B Toolkit</h5>
<p>In this month&rsquo;s call, Kelsey Florek and Kevin Libuit presented on the StaPH-B ToolKit. The StaPH-B ToolKit is a Python library written to relieve the burden of major bioinformatics challenges Kelsey and Kevin have identified throughout our respective regions: access to and proper use of StaPH-B docker images, capture of data lineage information, configurable and distributable pipeline parameters, and the portability of StaPH-B developed workflows. This call provided a brief overview of the StaPH-B ToolKit, its design concept, and its utility for public health laboratories. Following presentation,  a live-demo of the StaPH-B ToolKit was presented to demonstrate the simple installation requirements and its major functionalities using a sample dataset.

<p>For our December 2019 call, we have invited Lucy Li and David Dynerman from the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub to speak about Madrone, a user-friendly bioinformatics platform for cluster analysis and AMR gene detection for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Madrone was developed in collaboration between the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub and the Alameda County (CA) Public Health Laboratory to address Alameda&rsquo;s bioinformatics needs. Since its development, Madrone has been made available to a number of public health and healthcare facilities across the US. David and Lucy are leading the Madrone pilot program and are currently seeking other collaborators interested in accessing their platform.
