      <description>Every month the StaPH-B community gets together for an online presentation. These presenations are recorded and presented here for your review.
June 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 6: MicrobTrace In continuing our discussion regarding SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) genome analysis, we have invited Ellsworth Campbell to discuss MicrobeTrace, a &amp;ldquo;web-based tool to visually render networks from surveillance, epi investigations, and genetic analysis&amp;rdquo; that can be leveraged to support COVID-19 outbreak investigations. Ellsworth presented on the MicrobeTrace platform and provided useful information on how epidemiologists can utilize MicrobeTrace reports and visualizations to inform public health action.</description>

      <description>Amazon Web Services Batch is a service that allows users to submit jobs to job queues while specifying the application to be run and compute resources that are needed by the job. Working in concert with Nextflow, AWS Batch can be configured to run Nextflow processes in defined compute environments minimizing the cost of cloud resources.

      <description>Demystifying Webinar Series | February 2020 | AMR Detection Using NGS For our February 2020 webinar, we discuss how bacterial species identification is conducted using NGS data. This webinar will examine the different algorithms and databases used for AMR detection, with an emphasis on CGE’s ResFinder and NCBI’s AMRFinderPlus. Upon completion of the webinar, attendees will 1) understand the algorithms behind AMR detection using NGS, 2) the difference between gene based and mutational resistance, and 3) the advantages and limitations of these methods compared to traditional phenotypic testing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;For our January 2020 webinar, we discuss how bacterial species identification is conducted using NGS data. Topics focus on both average nucleotide identify (ANI) and Mash, how they are similar, how they are different, and when it is appropriate to use one versus the other.

      <description>The public health bioinformatics community is continuosly producing new training content for laboratorians and epidemiologists. Much of this focuses on new technology and its applications. But there is already a wealth of information and training content available if one knows where to look. This section hopes to serve as a resource where currently available material is identified and links provided to that content.
New York Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence The NY Integrated Food Safety CoE has extensive online materials for molecular epidemiology targeting both the laboratorian and epidemiologist.</description>

      <description>This glossary is adapted from Kelsey Florek and her Midwest Region AMD Pages on GitHub. The glossary is reproduced here for the benefit of those who cannot access GitHub.
Bioinformatics This discipline is involved in the collection, analysis, and storage of complex biological data, including, but not limited to genetic data. The field combines computer science, statistics, and several aspects of biology to be able to understand highly complex data.</description>

      <description>In the beginning&amp;hellip; Who are we? How did this all begin? Well, at first there were four: Kevin Libuit, Sean Wang, Kelly Oakeson, and Joel Sevinsky. And by four we mean there were at least four of us bothering Heather Carleton for help with bioinformatics of enteric pathogens around winter 2016/2017. Heather suggested, probably to save herself from answering too many questions and often the same question four times, that the group of should &amp;ldquo;talk amongst ourselves&amp;rdquo;, and our contact information was shared.</description>
