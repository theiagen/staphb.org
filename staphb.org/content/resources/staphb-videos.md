Every month the StaPH-B community gets together for an online presentation. These presenations are recorded and presented here for your review.

#### June 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 6: MicrobTrace
In continuing our discussion regarding SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) genome analysis, we have invited Ellsworth Campbell to discuss MicrobeTrace, a "web-based tool to visually render networks from surveillance, epi investigations, and genetic analysis" that can be leveraged to support COVID-19 outbreak investigations. Ellsworth presented on the MicrobeTrace platform and provided useful information on how epidemiologists can utilize MicrobeTrace reports and visualizations to inform public health action. Following this, we opened the floor for a Q&A session with Ellsworth.

#### May 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 5: Tailed Amplicon Sequencing
In continuing our discussion regarding SARS-CoV-2 analysis, we have invited Dr. Daryl Gohl from the University of Minnesota to discuss his most recent work: A Rapid, Cost-Effective Tailed Amplicon Method for Sequencing SARS-CoV-2.

The video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/lpnK4Gb_TSE).

#### May 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 4: EDGE
In this call, we continued our discussion regarding SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) genome analysis: Patrick Chain and his team (LANL) discussed a containerized workflow based on the EDGE platform for SC2 sequence data QC, genome assembly, and SNP analysis.

#### May 2020 - Bacterial Genome Analysis Using Bactopia
We've invited Robert Petit and Tim Read from Emory University to present on Bactopia, "an extensive workflow for processing Illumina sequencing of bacterial genomes. The goal of Bactopia is to process your data with a broad set of tools, so that you can get to the fun part of analyses quicker!"

This work was inspired by Staphopia, previous work from Tim and Robert presented to StaPH-B that also enabled extensive data processing, but was built specifically for Staphylococcus aureus read data. Tim and Robert have created a new series of pipelines called Bactopia, built on the Nextflow platform, to provide efficient comparative genomic analysis for any bacterial species or genus. Bactopia can be accessed through GitHub, Docker, Singularity, and Conda.

#### April 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 3: Local Nextstrain
As a follow up to our last call, during which Alli Black from the Bedford laboratory spoke about the NextStrain platform and its applications in COVID-19 response efforts, we invited Heather Blankenship--a bioinformatics scientist at the Michigan public health laboratory--to speak about her experience setting up a local NextStrain build for real-time COVID-19 surveillance in Michigan.

Heather discussed the advantages of local NextStrain builds for state laboratories and outlined the steps she has taken to set things up in her environment. Following this, we opened the floor for a Q&A session with Heather.

#### April 2020 - COVID-19 Special Epside 2: NextStrain
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilized our scheduled call to host a discussion regarding the various COVID-19 sequencing and analysis protocols available to the public health laboratories. A specific focus on the ARTIC Network's protocols for COVID-19 sequencing and genome assembly, as these seem the most appropriate for US state laboratories. Here are the [slides](https://storage.googleapis.com/staphb-resources/staphb-org-files/staphb-videos-page/alliblack-staphb-04-03-2020.pdf) for this presentation.

#### March 2020 - COVID-19 Special Episode 1: SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilized our scheduled call to host a discussion regarding the various COVID-19 sequencing and analysis protocols available to the public health laboratories. A specific focus on the ARTIC Network's protocols for COVID-19 sequencing and genome assembly, as these seem the most appropriate for US state laboratories.

##### February 2020 - Cromwell Workflow Manager
Danny Park, group lead of the viral computational genomics at the Broad Institute and technical consultant for the North East Bioinformatics Regional Resource, spoke about scientific compute workflow management.

##### January 2020 - StaPH-B Toolkit
In this month's call, Kelsey Florek and Kevin Libuit presented on the StaPH-B ToolKit. The StaPH-B ToolKit is a Python library written to relieve the burden of major bioinformatics challenges Kelsey and Kevin have identified throughout our respective regions: access to and proper use of StaPH-B docker images, capture of data lineage information, configurable and distributable pipeline parameters, and the portability of StaPH-B developed workflows. This call provided a brief overview of the StaPH-B ToolKit, its design concept, and its utility for public health laboratories. Following presentation,  a live-demo of the StaPH-B ToolKit was presented to demonstrate the simple installation requirements and its major functionalities using a sample dataset.

##### December 2019 - Madrone by Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub
For our December 2019 call, we have invited Lucy Li and David Dynerman from the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub to speak about Madrone, a user-friendly bioinformatics platform for cluster analysis and AMR gene detection for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Madrone was developed in collaboration between the Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub and the Alameda County (CA) Public Health Laboratory to address Alameda's bioinformatics needs. Since its development, Madrone has been made available to a number of public health and healthcare facilities across the US. David and Lucy are leading the Madrone pilot program and are currently seeking other collaborators interested in accessing their platform.

##### November 2019 - NGS Validations
For our November's call, we've invited Nick Matluk, the Microbiology and CLIA Technical Supervisor at the Maine state laboratory. Nick provided background on Maine's use of WGS to support infectious disease investigations and detailed their approach to CLIA validation of bioinformatics workflows on Qiagen's CLC Genomics Workbench platform.

##### October 2019 - Singularity Container System
For this month's call, we had a second discussion on container platforms: Jake Garfin (Minnesota Department of Health) and Curtis Kapsak (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) presented an overview of the Singularity container system, it's similarities and differences compared to Docker, and a short usage demonstration. This is particularly helpful for laboratories that are interested in using the StaPH-B Docker Images, but lack root privileges required to run Docker in their compute environments.

##### July 2019 - Scott Becker, Executive Director of APHL
Scott Becker, Executive Director of APHL spoke about the field of bioinformatics, its current impact on public health, and where things may be going in the years to come. Scott also offered his advice on keeping a workgroup like StaPH-B a cohesive and effective resource for public health.
